DEPRECATED: Causes issues with Unity at least from 2019.4
=============================================================

From Unity 2019.4 (may happen in earlier versions), this plugin can cause important edit-time issues in some situations, so don't use. It may not be updated to fix the issues. Please, use Unity's "Addressable Asset System" instead (https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/07/15/addressable-asset-system/).
